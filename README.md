# Rule Engine Application

## Overview
The Rule Engine application allows users to create, manage, and evaluate rules based on various user attributes (e.g., age, department, income).
It features a dynamic rule creation interface, a powerful backend for rule evaluation, and a responsive frontend for user interaction.
The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and includes Docker support for easy deployment.


## Features
- Dynamic creation and combination of rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- User-friendly interface for eligibility checks based on defined rules.
- Admin panel for managing rules and user data.
- Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.
- Docker support for easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha

## Architecture
The application follows a microservices architecture, where the backend and frontend are decoupled.
The backend serves a RESTful API that the frontend consumes.
